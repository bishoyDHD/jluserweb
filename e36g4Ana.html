        <h4> About the U(1) analysis from simulation </h4>
        <p> 
          This is a Geant4 and ROOT based toolkit for <i>Light neutral boson</i>. This tookit utilizes a custom ROOT-based generator. Below, results and sanity checks will be looked presented.

        <h4> Target Energy loss study using 2&gamma;</h4>
        <p>
          From the e36g4MC, the 2&gamma;'s undergo Compton scatter and can therefore experience some sort of energy loss in the target. We would like to understand the relationship between energy loss and the path length of a given track within the target. Below are some pictures dipicting this study.

          From the above figure, &gamma;<sub>1</sub> and &gamma;<sub>2</sub> have similar energy loss. Now, it is possible to this energy loss by considering the respective target parth lengths of &gamma;<sub>1</sub> and &gamma;<sub>2</sub>. This is shown below:

          This is really just a way of checking weather or not I can use this weird set-up. This is an incredible test. A test of great great and amazing stuff. Weird as it might be this is really just a test. Let us see how this happens.
